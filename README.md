This repo is a compilation of useful scripts and tools to interface, communicate,
and visualize data provided by the Evologics SR17 USBL and acoustic communication
modem. Specifically used for research and development using the AUV LoLo from
the Maritime Robotics Laboratory at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology as
part of the Swedish Maritime Robotics Centre (SMaRC) project.
